## Canoe Test Project.
#### By Ignacio Salcedo
This is, in essence, a Laravel project. It can be run following the
guide [here](https://laravel.com/docs/10.x/sail#installing-composer-dependencies-for-existing-projects).

All the new code can be tested by Unit Testing. I tried to get it covered as much as I could near to 100%.

I hope you like it and meet your expectations.
