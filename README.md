## Canoe Test Project.
#### By Ignacio Salcedo
This is, in essence, a Laravel project. It can be run following the
guide [here](https://laravel.com/docs/10.x/sail#installing-composer-dependencies-for-existing-projects).

All the new code can be tested by Unit Testing. I tried to get it covered as much as I could near to 100%.

I hope you like it and meet your expectations.

For the ER diagram. There is a PNG file in the root of the project. The most complex relationship was one many-to-many between funds and companies. Using the Company as source you can know how many funds it have, using the Fund as source, you can find how many companies are using it. Effective and simple.
